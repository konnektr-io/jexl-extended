# Usage Guides

These guides show you how to use JEXL Extended in your projects, from basic expression evaluation to advanced Monaco Editor integration.

## Getting Started

### [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started)
Learn the basics of JEXL Extended, installation, and your first expressions. Perfect for newcomers to JEXL.

### [Basic Usage](./basic-usage)
Comprehensive guide to using JEXL Extended as an expression evaluator in your JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## Integration Guides

### [Monaco Editor Integration](./monaco-integration)
Complete guide to integrating JEXL with Monaco Editor for rich IDE experience with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and hover documentation.

### [Advanced Usage](./advanced-usage)
Advanced patterns, performance optimization, error handling, and extending JEXL Extended with custom functionality.

## Quick Examples

### Expression Evaluation
```javascript
import jexl from 'jexl-extended';

const data = { users: [{ name: "Alice", age: 28 }, { name: "Bob", age: 32 }] };
const result = jexl.evalSync('users|filter("value.age > 30")|map("value.name")', data);
// ["Bob"]
```

### Monaco Editor Setup
```typescript
import * as monaco from "monaco-editor";
import { Monaco } from "jexl-extended";

Monaco.registerJexlLanguage(monaco);
const editor = Monaco.createJexlEditor(monaco, container, {
  value: 'users|filter("value.active")|map("value.name")',
  theme: "vs-dark"
});
```

### String Processing
```javascript
const text = "  Hello World  ";
const result = jexl.evalSync('text | trim | lowercase | split(" ") | join("-")', { text });
// "hello-world"
```

### Mathematical Operations
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const stats = jexl.evalSync('{
  sum: numbers | sum,
  average: numbers | average,
  max: numbers | max,
  count: numbers | length
}', { numbers });
// { sum: 15, average: 3, max: 5, count: 5 }
```

## Common Use Cases

### Data Transformation
Transform API responses, filter arrays, and manipulate objects with powerful expression chains.

### Form Validation
Create dynamic validation rules using JEXL expressions that can be stored and evaluated at runtime.

### Configuration Logic
Build flexible configuration systems where business rules are expressed as JEXL expressions.

### Template Processing
Process templates with dynamic content using JEXL expressions for calculations and formatting.

### Query Building
Create dynamic queries and filters using JEXL expressions that can be safely evaluated.
