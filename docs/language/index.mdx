# JEXL Language Guide

JEXL (JavaScript Expression Language) is a powerful expression language for evaluating expressions within JSON structures and JavaScript applications. This guide covers the complete JEXL syntax and language features.

## What is JEXL?

JEXL provides a simple, yet powerful syntax for:
- **Data transformation** - Transform objects and arrays
- **Filtering** - Select data based on conditions  
- **Calculations** - Perform mathematical operations
- **String manipulation** - Process and format text
- **Conditional logic** - Make decisions in expressions

## Language Sections

### [Syntax Overview](./syntax)
Learn the basic JEXL syntax, expression structure, and evaluation rules.

### [Data Types](./data-types)
Understand JEXL's data types: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null.

### [Operators](./operators)
Complete reference for all JEXL operators including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and more.

### [Expressions](./expressions)
Learn how to write complex expressions using functions, transforms, and nested operations.

### [Context and Variables](./context)
Understand how JEXL accesses data through context variables and property paths.

## Quick Examples

### Basic Expression
```javascript
// Simple property access
name
// Returns the 'name' property from context
```

### Array Operations
```javascript
// Filter and transform array
users|filter("value.age > 21")|map("value.name")
// Filters users by age, then extracts names
```

### Mathematical Calculations
```javascript
// Calculate percentage
(score / maxScore) * 100
// Calculates percentage from score and maxScore
```

### String Processing
```javascript
// Clean and format text
title | trim | lowercase | replace(" ", "-")
// Cleans title and converts to slug format
```

### Conditional Logic
```javascript
// Conditional expression
age >= 18 ? "adult" : "minor"
// Returns status based on age
```

## Key Concepts

### Expressions vs Statements
JEXL uses **expressions** that always return a value, not statements. Every JEXL expression evaluates to a result.

### Context-Driven
JEXL expressions are evaluated against a **context** - a JavaScript object that provides the data for the expression.

### Functional Style
JEXL encourages a functional programming style with transforms (pipe operations) that chain data transformations.

### Type Flexibility
JEXL handles JavaScript's dynamic typing, automatically converting between types when needed.
