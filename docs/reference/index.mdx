# Function Reference

JEXL Extended provides over 80 built-in functions and transforms organized into the following categories:

- [**Math**](./math): Mathematical operations and calculations (11 functions, 10 transforms)
- [**Array**](./array): Array operations and transformations (16 functions, 16 transforms)
- [**Encoding**](./encoding): Data encoding and formatting utilities (3 functions, 3 transforms)
- [**Conversion**](./conversion): Convert between different data types (8 functions, 8 transforms)
- [**String**](./string): String manipulation and formatting functions (14 functions, 14 transforms)
- [**Utility**](./utility): General utility functions (5 functions, 4 transforms)
- [**DateTime**](./datetime): Date and time operations (6 functions, 4 transforms)
- [**Object**](./object): Object manipulation and inspection (3 functions, 3 transforms)

## Usage

Functions are called directly:
```javascript
abs(-5) // Returns: 5
max([1, 2, 3]) // Returns: 3
```

Transforms are used with the pipe operator:
```javascript
"hello world" | uppercase // Returns: "HELLO WORLD"
[1, 2, 3] | map("value * 2") // Returns: [2, 4, 6]
```

Many functions can also be used as transforms when they have a single parameter.
